## General description [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)
This library is the Python 🐍 unofficial SDK for the EOD Historical data REST API. It's intended to be used for data extraction for financial valuations, macroeconomic analyses, sentiment analysis, option strategies, technical analysis, development of machine learning models, and more!

## Requirements [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)
- You need to request an API key with the EOD team. Create your account at the following [link](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/)
	- ***Please be aware of the pricing plans and policies. Different plans have different data accesses.***
- ```Python``` >= 3.8

If any update or change is informed through the [Medium site](https://eod-historical-data.medium.com/) site of the API, I will implement it SDK. The revisions will be every month.

## Installation [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)

```python
pip install eod
```

## Demo [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)
### REST API [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)
It's highly recommendable to save your API keys in the environment variable. A short tutorial can be founded in the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolxqkL7cD8):

[![Demo enviroment variables](https://j.gifs.com/LZlj1D.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IolxqkL7cD8)

```python
import os

# load the key from the enviroment variables
api_key = os.environ['API_EOD']

from eod import EodHistoricalData

# Create the instance 
client = EodHistoricalData(api_key)
# predefine some instruments
symbol='AAPL.US'
goverment_bond = 'SW10Y.GBOND'

# Quick usage
# weekly prices for the Swiss goverment bond
stock_prices = client.get_prices_eod(goverment_bond, period='w', order='a')

# Fundamental data for the stock
resp = client.get_fundamental_equity(symbol, filter_='Financials::Balance_Sheet::quarterly')
```
### Websocket [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk): 
The EOD API have real-time data with a delay of less than 50ms via WebSockets for the US market, FOREX, and Cryptocurrencies. For US stocks our real-time data API supports pre-market and post-market hours (from 4 am till 8 pm EST). WebSockets API is available within All World Extended and/or All-In-One packages. More details in the [documentation](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/financial-apis/new-real-time-data-api-websockets/)
```python
import os
import json
# load the key from the enviroment variables
api_key = os.environ['API_EOD']

# Import WebSocket client library
from websocket import create_connection

# Connect to WebSocket API and subscribe to trade feed for Ethereum and Bitcoin
ws = create_connection(f"wss://ws.eodhistoricaldata.com/ws/crypto?api_token={api_key}")
ws.send('{"action": "subscribe", "symbols": "ETH-USD,BTC-USD"}')

# Infinite loop waiting for WebSocket data
while True:
    result = ws.recv()
    result = json.loads(result)
    print(result)
```

## Documentation [:arrow_up:](#eod-historical-data-sdk)
Please be aware that some descriptions will come directly from the API's documentation because no further explanations were needed for the specific method. Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, I will use the following convention along with the whole document: 

```python

from eod import EodHistoricalData
# create the instance of the SDK
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE'
client = EodHistoricalData(api_key)
```
